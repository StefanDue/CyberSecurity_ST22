We received the following ciphertext which was encoded with a shift cipher:

UKGIGP YKTF FGT FGUUGP CTOGG KP CNNGP TCGPIGP XQO INGKEJGP IGKUV DGUGGNV KUV

 

1. Perform an attack against the cipher based on a letter frequency count: How many letters do you have to identify through a frequency count to recover the key? What is the cleartext?

2. Was passiert bei der Caesar-Verschluesselung mit dem Histogram?
